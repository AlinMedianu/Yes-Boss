# Yes-Boss
Yes Boss was made during a two day game jam event organized by SHSU Games Development Society, with the "interesting" theme of "Mr. Secretary". My main roles were to create the pipe logic, that determines how the papers are spawned and moved, and to import the pipe assets, while making sure they are positioned, rotated and scaled properly for display.
